1)	Introduction Subject Area, 
In the past security companies were managing their security personnel, deployment 
of people on the field, organizing the duty schedules, and flow of information 
through the so-called “traditional means”, such as using Excel spreadsheets 
for post deployment, in which each change was manually updated. Mangers in order 
to ensure that all posts are covered with necessary personnel were going line by line 
in the spreadsheet. 
In many situations this manual approach resulted in inefficient post deployment 
which led to either posts were not covered with enough personnel, or were deployed with more people that actually are needed. 
Another very important issue which company and their employees faced is poor flow of 
important information which were necessary for conducting daily activities, 
because information was passed to the employees manually, by means of phone or via SMS.
Due to the problems described above company was losing customers, expenses regarding 
managing were very high due to the fact that company needed large number of mangers 
to keep track of the post’s deployment, organizing duty schedules, mangers for 
managing employees annual leave plans, and other types of absence. 
Another problem that arises from “dark age” management approach was that 
senior management and company owners did not receive prompt up-to-date information 
in order to make strategic decisions which will led to grow of the company. 

2)	Aim – The goal of project – 
In order to solve above problems, to maximize efficiency and use of resources, 
and automate many of the processes, who were identified as weak links.
Implementation i.e., development of the software system is necessary, 
to automate the problematic managerial processes, and information flow. 

3)	Objectives 
Suggested  system will designed and engineered with the following modules: 
•	Post deployment, scheduling and personnel managing information system
•	Decision-support system 


Post deployment, scheduling and personnel managing information system is built 
with following modules: 
Post management
Duty schedules
Annual leave, and sick leave days tracking 
Reporting module 
 
4)	intend to achieve the aim of the project. 
To maximize efficiency and use of resources
5)	Resources needed and timescale. 
For development of the system will be used GO programming language, 
for the database PostgreSQL, both the WebAPP and database will be deployed 
as docker container.
